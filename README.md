# Temporal Summation with Hodgkin-Huxley
An interactive Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model by Bradley Dowling.

With this interactive demo, users are able to simulate an injection of current into a neuron
and watch the membrane potential change over time and summate over multiple injections. If a user
inputs enough current, the membran will spike an action potential.
